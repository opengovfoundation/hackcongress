General Repository for the Harvard Ash Center Hackathon ( January 30 - February 1 )

#HackCongress (aka Sudo Fix Congress)
A “Not-Just-for-Technologists” Event to Fix Congress 
organized by Harvard Kennedy School's Ash Center for Democratic Governance & Innovation 
& the OpenGov Foundation

Friday, January 30 through Sunday, February 1
Harvard Kennedy School of Government
 
About the Event

As an institution, Congress is perhaps the most important in our democracy—but it appears to be broken. While hyper-partisanship and the influence of money often lead the list of complaints, Congress’ problems include the absence of effective deliberation, under-representation of constituent preferences, and lack of access to the lawmaking process. Congress needs “fixes”—but where will these new tools and solutions come from? By bringing together political scientists, technologists, designers, lawyers, organizational psychologists, and lawmakers, HackCongress will lead to new digital tools, policy innovations, or other design solutions to address the growing dysfunction in Congress.

The word “hack,” in hackathon means to use every tool at your disposal to create innovative solutions to pressing problems.  The ethos of hacking is to see every problem as solvable through creativity and innovation, no matter how daunting or entrenched.  “Hacking” is not just for technologists.  “Hacks” include innovations in policy, architecture, organizational process, art and design, and educational materials, as well as new software and technologies.

Come hack Congress. Join political scientists and policy experts, technologists, architects, and designers, at HackCongress at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government.  In addition to our hosts, HackCongress organizers include The OpenGov Foundation, Sunlight Foundation, Congressional Management Foundation, Code for Boston, Microsoft, CODE2040, [these are confirmed, others to come].

Solutions presented at the end of the hackathon will be evaluated by a panel of judges. Winning projects will be invited to present and build upon their projects at a second hackathon hosted by The OpenGov Foundation on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. in spring 2015. The winning idea from the DC hackathon will gain exposure from lawmakers or other high-level officials inside Congress. Help move our democracy forward.

HackCongress 2014 Example Solutions & Projects (We will create separate repositories for each project.)

Projects could draw on the fields of organizational behavior/process design, material design, policy and political science, architecture, project management approaches, education and communications--the sky’s the limit.

Projects can also build off of existing technologies, such as The OpenGov Foundation’s Madison, a collaborative online document-drafting platform. Madison is open source and available on GitHub.

Challenge:  Improving the Lawmaking Process

Solution: Rethinking the Brainstorming Process For New Laws
Problem: Many members and staffers rely heavily on intermediaries, such as think tanks, pollsters, and lobbyists, to identify pressing issues and to understand constituents’ perspectives on those issues. Policymakers need a better way to understand their constituents’ priorities and to vet policy ideas before the bill-drafting stage.
Hackathon Projects:
1) Build a “District Dashboard” that provides real time feedback and data to member offices on the issues faced by their district and the perspectives of their constituents.

Solution: Legislative “Templates”
Problem: Drafting new laws from scratch takes time away from any policies are written in very similar fashion and it would be more efficient to have standard templates from which to start drafting.  
Hackathon Projects:  
1) Build an inventory of different types of legislation, legislative structures, necessary components, language, etc. so that we can start to determine how to construct legislative templates.

Challenge:  Facilitating Cross-Partisan Dialogue

Solution: Create a Platform for Open and Civil Cross-Partisan Deliberation
Problem:  Some say that Congress is now more polarized than at any time since the end of Reconstruction, and that the polarization of the political parties that began in the 1970’s has resulted in over 93% of roll call votes in the 113th resting on ideological lines alone.  The hectic schedule of Washington, along with compressed work weeks and the fact that most congresspeople do not live in D.C., has eaten away at the traditional spaces for cross-partisan socializing and deliberation.  
Hackathon Projects:
1) Build a “Cross-Partisan Deliberation” app that allows for curated discourse on pressing policy issues, from the most contentious to the least.  Allow members and staffers identification verification to prevent imposters, but provide anonymous user accounts that only identify party affiliation.  Establish curated discussion rooms by issue and a rating systems that allows users to rank issues by level of division.  This would visualize which issues inspire the greatest rancor, but also which issues might have more consensus than anticipated.  Develop additional features that draw upon recent political science research on deliberation facilitation.

Challenge:  Innovations in Participation

Solution: Participatory Hearings
Problem: Participating in committee hearings remains one of the most powerful ways citizens can shape legislation, and an important way for lawmakers to tap into key expertise when creating policy. But few Americans have the time and resources to participate in in-person hearings. Opening up hearings online could create a more inclusive and effective means of crafting policy.
Hackathon Projects:
1) Build an online live hearing tool with participatory features such as chat and introductory materials on the policy issues addressed, that would allow Americans to attend congressional hearings and engage with lawmakers from home.

Solution: Participatory Budgeting
Problem: Most Americans have little say in where public money is spent at the federal level.  The budget process is complicated and not always transparent.  The electoral process is blunt tool and is incapable of communicating the nuance necessary to understand public perspectives on how public resources are distributed.  Many states and other countries have implemented formal programs to involve their citizens in the budgeting process with great success.
Hackathon Projects:
1) Design a participatory budgeting process for Congress.  Draw on successful programs developed and implemented elsewhere that are documented on Participedia.
2) Design a software platform that would allow for public education, deliberation, and comment on matters of public revenue and finance.

Solution: Democracy Vouchers
Problem: The fundraising process for campaigns is taking up more and more of lawmakers’ time in Washington as campaigns become increasingly more expensive.  Most Americans outside of Washington have little engagement with the formal fundraising process and lack access to most events where lawmakers make themselves available to supporters.  Moreover, Congress generally allows for only one mechanism of formal engagement in the democratic process--the vote.  Democracy Vouchers would provide an additional means of engagement outside of the vote where Americans could communicate their perspectives to Congress in a meaningful way.
Hackathon Projects:
1)  Design a “Democracy Voucher” system that would provide tax credits in the form of vouchers to each American that they could use to signal their preferences about lawmakers and their policies by contributing that voucher to a congressional campaign.  The system would allow for regular updates to the lawmakers as to where their constituents are contributing the voucher in order for the lawmaker to have real time information on constituent preferences.  Draft sample legislation and design the software platform where voucher data would be aggregated and visualized.     

Challenge:  Closing the Representation Gap

Solution: Teaching Everyone How Congress Works and How to Connect
Problem: Congress is complicated; not understanding the way legislating works can keep citizens from getting involved, and makes it difficult for lawmakers to effectively communicate policy positions to constituents.
Hackathon Projects:
1) Design a game, interactive website, flow chart, infographic, video, or other means to educate outsiders on how legislating really works in the 21st Century.
2) Design an annual congressional “open house” when lawmakers could demonstrate and publicize how outsiders can engage with Congress and participate in the lawmaking process.

Solution:  Formalize the Petition Process
Problem: At the Founding, Congress recognized a formal right of individuals and minorities to petition Congress for redress of grievances, which was so fundamental that it is protected by the First Amendment.  Today, the right to petition exists only in an informal way in Congress that is opaque to everyday Americans and utilized mostly by professional lobbyists.  In our current informal system, access to lawmakers is sorted in the same way as the electoral process: we afford preferenced access to political supporters and the politically powerful.  But the Framers had a very different sorting mechanism for the petition process:  individuals and associations gained access by virtue of having a grievance or a particular stake in the lawmaking process.  
Hackathon Projects:
1) Design a formal petition process that is scaleable to today’s large and complex society, and allows for individuals and associations with a stake in pending laws or pressing issues to have a transparent and formal way to have their grievances heard and, at the very least, deliberated on by Congress.

Solution: Making Legislation Easy to Read for Everyone (Not Just Lawyers)
Problem: Legislation is written by lawyers in very complicated “legalese.”  Overly complicated statutory language can serve as a barrier to broad particapation, especially by everyday Americans who aren’t well-versed in the intricacies of legal language.
Hackathon Projects:
1)  Develop a translation guide for legislative drafting that provides simple english words to replace complicated and opaque legal terms.
2)  Apply NLP to legislation and provide a readability score that would serve as a benchmark for understandable policy.

Solution:  Citizens’ Assemblies
Problem:  Political scientists have documented that only a narrow slice of elites are active in the political process.  This means that Congress often only hears from this very narrow slice when identifying issues to address, prioritizing issues on its agenda, and in forming policy solutions.  Congress needs another, more representative, way to engage with the broader public.
Hackathon Projects:
1) Design a process whereby members could convene citizen assemblies by sortition, or lottery, to deliberate on particular policy issues and provide formal feedback to Congress in order to gauge public opinion and to inspire innovative solutions to contentious policy problems.  

Solution: Making Legislation Machine Readable
Problem: Legislative language is typically very complicated and difficult to understand.  Many pieces of legislation are also extremely lengthy.  Advances in search and database technologies have improved the way that we engage with large amounts of data and text.  But legislation is not drafted in a way that is standardized and, therefore, is not easily read by search technologies and other tools of data simplification.  Because of this, legislation is often inaccessible.  
Hackathon Projects:
1) Using natural language processing or other resources, build a set of tools that can attempt to identify certain aspects of legislation including actionable sections, categorization, and similar legislation.
